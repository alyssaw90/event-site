        <h3>What is the difference between a Plugfest and other interop events?</h3>
        <p>Plugfests are focused on Open Specifications for Microsoft Protocols. During Plugfests, attendees can use protocol test suites that help evaluate whether an implementation's protocol communications conform to the relevant Microsoft Open Specifications.</p>
        <p>Other interoperability events are focused on a wider range of developer focused topics such the opportunity of developing within Office365, Windows, and Cloud + Enterprise. Our developer focused events contain hack sessions where attendees are encouraged to build within Microsoft products. Overall, Plugfests are more focused on Open Specifications and testing protocols with other interop events are focused on the developer experience. </p>
