      		<h3>What is the difference between a Plugfest and other interop events?</h3>
      		<p focusable="true">Plugfests are focused on Open Specifications for Microsoft Protocols. During Plugfests, attendees can use protocol test suites that help evaluate whether an implementation's protocol communications conform to the relevant Microsoft Open Specifications.</p>
      		<p focusable="true">Other interoperability events are focused on a wider range of developer-focused topics such the opportunity of developing within Office365, Windows, and Cloud + Enterprise. Our developer-focused events contain hack sessions where attendees are encouraged to build within Microsoft products. Overall, Plugfests are more focused on Open Specifications and testing protocols and other interop events are focused on the developer experience. </p>

			<p focusable="true">Microsoft interoperability events differ from other tech events for several reasons.</p>
			<ol>

				<li><b>We are here to help you.</b> The reason our team travels the globe is to work with developers like yourself. We want to get to know you, answer your questions, and provide our expertise. We’re ready to sit down and dig into your code.</li>
				<li><b>We’re the people who made it.</b> Get Microsoft product help directly from the people who designed it. There is no need to scour help forums when the Microsoft engineers are standing right in front of you.</li>
				<li><b>It's your event, on us.</b> Microsoft interoperability events and Plugfests are free. As part of Microsoft interoperability, our goal is to make our events affordable for all developers. Microsoft interoperability events are focused on building knowledge, not selling tickets. It’s your event, our treat.</li>
