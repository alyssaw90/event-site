    <h2>Microsoft Interop Events</h2>
    <p>Through the Open Specifications program, Microsoft is helping developers open new opportunities by making technical documents related to interoperability for certain popular Microsoft products available to view and download from MSDN at no charge. Microsoft offers developers the chance to learn more about specific protocols and to test their implementations of those protocols at Plugfests. Plugfests include one-on-one discussions with Microsoft engineers and the use of protocol test suites that help evaluate whether an implementation's protocol communications conform to the relevant Microsoft Open Specifications. Most recently, Open Specifications launched Interop Dev Days to focus on Office 365 developer opportunities, Data Platform, and interoperability.</p>

    <h2>Interop Dev Days</h2>
    <p>With the continued success of Open Specifications events, the concept of the Plugfest has evolved and led to the creation of Interop Dev Days. The Open Specifications team created Interop Dev Days to highlight the opportunity of developing with Office 365. In collaboration with O365 development and Open Specifications, Cloud + Enterprise brings content from SQL Server, OData, Power BI, and Big Data. Interop Dev Days includes hack sessions where attendees are encouraged to build and complete an Office Add-in or OData project. The combination of O365 development, Cloud + Enterprise, and the traditional protocol implementation allows for Interop Dev Days to reach a new audience, introduce fresh content, and explore a different event structure.</p>

    <h2>Microsoft Protocols Plugfests</h2>
    <p>Microsoft-hosted protocols plugfests provide software developers with the opportunity to learn more about the Microsoft protocols and to test their implementations of the Microsoft Open Specifications. Hosted on the Microsoft Redmond campus, each plugfest focuses on a specific task or technology area. Presentations are conducted by Microsoft engineers, who are also available for one-on-one and group discussions and to provide necessary assistance with configuration and running of the interoperability tests. Testing includes the use of protocol test suites that help evaluate whether an implementation's protocol communications conform to the relevant Microsoft Open Specifications.</p>
    <h4>Attendees at a Microsoft protocols plugfest can expect the following:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Technology presentations regarding Open Specifications for Microsoft Protocols</li>
      <li>Group presentations from members of the Microsoft product teams</li>
      <li>Interoperability testing on the relevant Microsoft products</li>
      <li>Access to Microsoft protocol test suites or other tools for interoperability testing of Partner Server implementations</li>
      <li>Opportunities to field questions and obtain answers directly from Microsoft</li>
      <li>1:1 sessions with product development team members</li>
      <li>Assistance from technical support personnel</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>File Format Events</h2>
    <p>Microsoft-hosted file format events provide software developers with the opportunity to test their implementations of the Office file formats.  Similar testing opportunities for implementations of the Open XML and Open Document Format (ODF) are available through the Document Interoperability Initiative.</p>

    <h2>Document Interoperability Initiative</h2>
    <h4>Industry collaboration to create solutions</h4>
    <p>While significant progress has been made in document interoperability with the adoption of multiple open standards and supporting translation tools, there is still much work to be done. To solve the industry's pressing interoperability problems, leaders must collaborate to identify and overcome interoperability barriers. The Document Interoperability Initiative is a global program of technical vendor discussions, labs, and solution enablement programs to develop solutions for effective data exchange between product implementations of document format standards. This initiative is open to any vendor who wants to collaborate with the community to create these solutions identify and address interoperability issues between different implementations of document formats. They are encouraged to propose meetings, raise issues, and help set the agenda for the effort. Users of information technologies are also encouraged to participate to help prioritize and focus the efforts of vendors. The Document Interoperability Initiative is community based and open to all participants wanting to promote document format interoperability for the benefit of the user community.</p>
    <h4>The Document Interoperability Initiative goals include:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Test interoperability between product implementations of document format standards in some common scenarios including enterprise server (back office, unstructured data, schema across supply chains)</li>
      <li>and data authoring, presentation, and exchange across a range of devices.</li>
      <li>Identify systematic gaps that can be addressed via industry collaboration.</li>
      <li>Identify issues with specific implementations or between implementations.</li>
    </ul>
